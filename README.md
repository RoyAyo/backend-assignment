# Movie Database Backend Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to our Movie Database Backend project! In this project, we're developing a backend application that will serve as the foundation for our movie database. Our goal is to create a platform where users can interact with a wide variety of movies, rate them, and explore based on their interests.

## Tech Stack

**Nest.JS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.

**TypeScript**: Bringing the benefits of strong typing and modern JavaScript features to our backend development.

**PostgreSQL**: A robust and reliable relational database management system, ensuring data integrity and performance.

**TypeORM**: A versatile ORM that simplifies database interactions and streamlines development with TypeScript support.

<u>**Hexagonal Architecture Pattern**</u>: Structuring our application in a modular and maintainable way, promoting separation of concerns and testability.

## Key Features

### Movie Management

Our platform will host a vast collection of movies. Each movie will have its own page with detailed information such as title, release date, description, and genre. Users can explore the entire movie database and discover new films.

### Rating Functionality

Users will have the ability to rate movies on a scale, helping us gauge the popularity and quality of each film in our database. This interactive feature not only allows users to express their opinions but also influences how movies are presented and recommended to others.

### Functionalities

- **Get all movies**: Users can access a comprehensive list of all available movies.
- **Filter by genre**: Users can narrow down their search by selecting specific genres of interest.
- **Rate a movie**: Users can rate a movie, providing feedback on their experience and contributing to the overall rating of the film.
- **Sort by rating**: Users can view movies ranked by user ratings, helping them discover popular and highly-rated films.

### Note:

For testing the endpoints, no frontend is required. Postman or any API testing tool should be sufficient to interact with this backend API.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
